# Wassily

**Wassily** is both an API and set of tools for creating generative 2D art. It allows you to create
images that can easily be scaled to any size without loss of quality. It is useful for images that
are meant to be printed at large sizes or displayed on screen. Included are many generative art
algorithms and utilities for dealing with colors and noise.
